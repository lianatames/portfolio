    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a creative and hard-working person who is always interested in taking
      on new innovative projects. I have a keen interest in computers and the
      video game industry, and I am always keeping up to date with the latest
      trends. I love working in team environments whether it be in sports such
      as soccer or working towards a goal in a video game development team. I am
      competent in a variety of programming languages and game development
      programs.
      <br />
      I am a very keen learner and can pick up on new concepts fast, I enjoy
      opportunities to learn new skills. I am naturally a detail-oriented
      person and continually work to ensure that I keep the big picture in mind.
      To do this I prioritize tasks in order of importance or urgency to ensure
      that they are completed to meet deadlines. This allows me to be very
      meticulous towards my work and always strive to achieve the highest of
      quality for each task. I utilize constructive feedback to improve on my
      work to ensure I meet design goals. I am always trying to improve my
      communication skills which will allow me to be clearer and more concise
      with ideas that I share. I believe these attributes make me a valuable asset to
      any team environment.

    <h2>Awards and Acknowledgments</h2>
    <h3>Video Game Design Project - 'Trainhem'</h3>
    <p>
      As part of my Bachelor studies I completed a Major Video Games Project in
      which I worked with a small team as the Lead Vision Holder and a Secondary
      Programmer to design and build a game named ‘Trainhem’. This involved us
      developing the game idea which we pitched to industry professionals at SMG
      Studio to receive feedback before developing the game. This required me to
      coordinate tasks with people and manage communication within our team to
      make sure we met deadlines, as well as making design decisions, level
      design and assist with the programming. <br><br>
      We were given 14 weeks to design
      and build the game. Trainhem is a top down, 2D, puzzle game that was
      developed for mobile devices. The goal of each level is to get the train
      safely from the start to the end by rotating each hexagonal tile piece to
      line up the tracks. Each level increases in difficulty as more types of
      trains are introduced which are faster or longer, as well as having
      multiple trains at one time. <br><br>
      For this project our team was recognised by
      the University, the Head of the Department of Computing and Unit Convenor
      for our outstanding results and excellent performance in this unit that
      has placed us in an elite top performing group.
