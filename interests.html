              <b>The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II</b><br />
              These games have some of the best level design out of all the games
              I have played and is an all-time favourite of mine. The level design
              in these games is what I aspire to create. The sound design is also
              incredible, as well as all the details in the environmental
              storytelling. I hope to put the same amount of detail in the games
              that I will create one day.

              <b>Horizon Zero Dawn</b><br />
              The story and world building is original, incredible and immersive.
              The enemy designs are unique and the combat is very fun. Even after
              finishing the story it was fun to complete all the side quests which
              fleshed out the world and characters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>The Uncharted Series</b><br />
              These are some of my favourite games. Naughty Dog consistently
              creates beautiful stories and worlds that capture the player. The
              level design is also incredible in these games.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Overwatch</b><br />
              Overwatch has excellent level design, character design, and sound
              design, which creates an engaging and fast paced team shooter which
              keeps me coming back to play the game after all these years.
